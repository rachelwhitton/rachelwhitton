Search is critical for your site, but the default search for WordPress leaves a lot to be desired. Improve your user experience with the Apache Solr search engine for your WordPress website.

* Fast results, with better accuracy
* Enables faceting on fields such as tags, categories, author, and page type.
* Indexing and faceting on custom fields
* Completely replaces default WordPress search, just install and configure.
* Completely integrated into default WordPress theme and search widget.
* Very developer-friendly: uses the modern [Solarium](http://www.solarium-project.org/) library

## Installation ##

The Solr Power plugin can be installed just like you'd install any other WordPress plugin. Because Solr Power is intended to be a bridge between WordPress and the Apache Solr search engine, you'll need access to a functioning Solr instance for the plugin to work as expected.

If you're using the Solr Power plugin on Pantheon, setting up Apache Solr is as easy as enabling the Apache Solr add-on in your Pantheon dashboard. Once you've done so:

1. Index your existing content by going to the plugin options screen and selecting the applicable **Actions**:
   - - **Index Searchable Post Types**
2. Search on!
3. See the examples/templates directories for more rich implementation guidelines.

If you're using the Solr Power plugin elsewhere, you'll need to install and configure Apache Solr. On a Linux environment, this involves three steps:

1. Install the Java Runtime Environment.
2. Run `./bin/install-solr.sh` to install and run Apache Solr on port 8983.
3. Configuring Solr Power to use this particular Solr instance by setting the `PANTHEON_INDEX_HOST` and `PANTHEON_INDEX_PORT` environment variables.

In a local development environment, you can point Solr Power to a custom Solr instance by creating a MU plugin with:

```
<?php

putenv( 'PANTHEON_INDEX_HOST=192.168.50.4' ); // Replace with the appropriate IP address
putenv( 'PANTHEON_INDEX_PORT=8983' );

add_filter( 'solr_scheme', function(){ return 'http'; });
```

To get local styles and JavaScript for testing or other use you will need to compile the assets using grunt. The following will get you going:

1. `npm -g install grunt grunt-cli`
2. From the repo: `npm install`
3. `grunt`

Note that if you're making changes to the CSS or JS you can run `grunt watch` from the repository directory. This will watch the admin.js file and all .scss files and compile new assets when they are changed.

## Development ##

This plugin is under active development on GitHub:

[https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power)

Please feel free to file issues there. Pull requests are also welcome!

You may notice there are two sets of tests running, on two different services:

* Travis CI runs the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite against a Solr instance.
* Circle CI runs the [Behat](http://behat.org/) test suite against a Pantheon site, to ensure the plugin's compatibility with the Pantheon platform.

Both of these test suites can be run locally, with a varying amount of setup.

PHPUnit requires the [WordPress PHPUnit test suite](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/), and access to a database with name `wordpress_test`. If you haven't already configured the test suite locally, you can run `bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost`. You'll also need access to a running Solr instance, in order to run the unit tests against Solr.

Behat requires a Pantheon site with Solr enabled. Once you've created the site, you'll need [install Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus#installation), and set the `TERMINUS_TOKEN`, `TERMINUS_SITE`, and `TERMINUS_ENV` environment variables. Then, you can run `./bin/behat-prepare.sh` to prepare the site for the test suite.

Note that dependencies are installed via Composer and the `vendor` directory is not committed to the repository. You will need to run `composer install` locally for the plugin to function. You can read more about Composer [here](https://getcomposer.org)
